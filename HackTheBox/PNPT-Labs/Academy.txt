- nmap scan: nmap -T4 -A -p- 10.129.187.176
- guessed that php was the programming language used (it always is...)
- ftp as anonymous allowed us to download notes.txt that had a user account login
- logging in, we found a page that allows php uploads
- uploaded pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell
- we then got linpeas.sh to run on the victim in tmp folder from our http server to hunt for priv escalation opportunities
- revealed /var/www/html/academy/includes/config.php that has a user account name and password
- also revealed a .sh file grimmie has running periodically for a backup
- su grimmie to switch user and use that password
- crontab to view script schedules - doesn't help us in this case, but useful sometimes
	- same for systemctl list-timers
- pspy tool ran on the victim shows that thie /home/grimmie/backup.sh is run every minute
- we edit the backup.sh file with a one-liner bash reverse shell by pentestmonkey (the backup cronjob is run as root)
