Security Projects and Notes

This repository is a collections of notes from labs completed from HackerRank, TryHackMe, and HackTheBox. Additionally, I have included a web application pentest write-up that I completed as part of a technical interview. Finally, I have also linked the formal Penetration Testing report I created as part of an engagement during my Penetration Testing course at NYU.

My intention is to demonstrate my process, not to leak any solutions.
