- Volatility 3 is the world's most widely used framework for extracting digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples.
Volatility commands used:
	- vol -f “/path/to/file” windows.pstree ---- find unusual/malicious process (.exe)
	- vol -f “/path/to/file” windows.cmdline --- find path to malicious exe
	- vol -f “/path/to/file” windows.netscan --- find attempts to reach c2 server
	- vol -f /home/ubuntu/Desktop/'Start here'/Artifacts/'Windows 7 x64-Snapshot4.vmem' windows.memmap.Memmap --pid 2748 --dump, then strings pid.2748.dmp | grep 'GET /' --- view all GET requests (to c2 server)
	- python3 vol.py -f "/home/ubuntu/Desktop/Start here/Artifacts/Windows 7 x64-Snapshot4.vmem" windows.filescan | grep 'clip64' -- to see where the downloaded files were stored
	- python3 vol.py -f "/home/ubuntu/Desktop/Start here/Artifacts/Windows 7 x64-Snapshot4.vmem" windows.pstree -- run again to see which child process is used to run the newly downloaded dll
	- python3 vol.py -f "/home/ubuntu/Desktop/Start here/Artifacts/Windows 7 x64-Snapshot4.vmem" windows.filescan | grep 'lssass.exe' -- to see an additional location that the malware lives to ensure consistent presence
