- LLMNR enables the resolution of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses into hostnames without any need for a DNS server on the local network
- if a DNS request fails, a LLMNR query is mad e on the local network to resolve that request. 
- LLMNR does not require authentication for those name resolutions, thus an attacker listening on the local network can respond to those queries with their own IP address -> LLMNR poisoning
- the biggest help was to filter "ntlmssp" to see specifically the NTLM Auth Negotiations -- this was key
