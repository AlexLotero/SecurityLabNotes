Malware analysis tools: VirusTotal and Hybrid Analysis (we are given the hash of the malware)

- both have their strengths -- best used together
- hybrid analysis includes a search function for "Extracted Strings" -- helpful in the case where you know what you may be looking for (e.g. ".dat")
- malware family can be found with google search
